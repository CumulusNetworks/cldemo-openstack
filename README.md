# Cumulus Networks EVPN Demos for [Cumulus VX](https://cumulusnetworks.com/products/cumulus-vx/)

------------------------

This Github repository contains the configuration files necessary for setting up Openstack Pike with EVPN (Ethernet VPN) using Cumulus Linux and FRR on the [Reference Topology](http://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-vagrant).

The [configuration files](config/) in this repository will set up a BGP unnumbered routing fabric between the leafs and spines, and will use MLAG trunks between switches and the servers in that rack.

Quickstart: Dual-Attach (MLAG) Demo
------------------------
    git clone https://github.com/cumulusnetworks/cldemo-openstack
    cd cldemo-openstack
    git checkout cldemo-evpn
    vagrant up leaf01 leaf02 leaf03 leaf04 spine01 spine02 server01 server02 server03 server04
    vagrant ssh server01
    sudo su - cumulus
    ping 172.16.1.102
    ping 172.16.1.103
    ping 172.16.1.104

The ansible will change the subnet when it installs openstack.

## Install Openstack
--------------------
Copy and paste the setup script in the repo into a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 host to prepare it for running the cldemo-* topologies with vagrant + libvirt 

To deploy the Openstack hosts, simply execute: 
    ansible-playbook openstack.yml


### Detailed Instructions and Documentation
---------------------------------------
[EVPN Documentation](https://docs.cumulusnetworks.com/display/DOCS/Ethernet+Virtual+Private+Network+-+EVPN)
The EVPN Documentation was built around this demo and makes walking through this demo a breeze.  Please report problems with this demo using the "issues" tab above.

## Troubleshooting Commands

 * `bridge fdb show` shows the mac-address table for local and remote VTEPs
 * `show ip bgp summary` shows BGP IPv4 neighbor adjacencies
 * `show bgp evpn summary` shows BGP EVPN neighbor adjacencies
 * `show bgp evpn vni` shows VNIs that this device is participating in (only works on a VTEP)
 * `show evpn vni` shows remote VTEPs that share VNIs that this switch is participating in (only works on a VTEP)
 * `show evpn mac vni all` show MAC address information learned per VNI
 * `show bgp evpn route` show all EVPN routes


### Requirements
----------------------
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) (recommended 2.1.2)

and

[KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Downloads)

Factory-reset a device
----------------------
    vagrant destroy -f leaf01
    vagrant up leaf01

Destroy the entire topology
---------------------------
    vagrant destroy -f

KVM Support
---------------------------
By default this Vagrantfile is setup for KVM.

All other directions remain the same
